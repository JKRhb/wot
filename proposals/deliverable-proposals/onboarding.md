# Onboarding

## Motivation
In order to establish secure communications in some contexts, for example on a LAN,
some form of onboarding process to establish mutual trust between Things and
Consumers is needed.  Having a prescriptive (but optional) process for this
would be useful, and may also include additional steps such as registration with
a WoT Discovery service.

## Description

<p>
In this work item we will define mechanisms to perform minimum-effort
onboarding of
Things in a secure way that conforms to the security and privacy requirements
of specific deployment scenarios and use cases.
</p>
<p>
This work item complements the work that is done for device discovery,
however is also applicable for other use cases.
