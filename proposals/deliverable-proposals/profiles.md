# WoT Profiles

## Motivation
In order to address important interoperability use cases among diverse stakeholders, 
the WoT profile 1.0 specification has been developed.
This work will continue with a wider scope to address other use cases and scenarios,
including deployments in large scale cloud systems, edge devices, digital twins,
and on resource constrained devices.

## Description

Initially this work item will focus on delivering the Profile 1.1 specification.

In addition, specification work for other profiles, including the following profiles will be carried out:  
* Digital Twin Profile
* Cloud Profile
* Constraint Device Profile
* Profiles for other protocols (e.g. CoAP, MQTT)
