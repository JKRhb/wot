# WoT Scripting API

## Motivation
Scripting is an optional building block in WoT and it is typically used in
gateways or browsers that are able to run a WoT Runtime and script management,
providing a convenient way to extend WoT support to new types of endpoints
and implement WoT applications such as Thing Directory.

## Description

The Scripting API supports both, exposing and consuming Thing Descriptions
while providing a high-level interface to interactions that is independent
of protocol. The work will continuously align with the WoT TD specification. 
Besides these efforts, alignment with the WoT Discovery specification will
be the main topic.

## Changes

The W3C note will be changed to [Note Track](https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#note-track)
which allows for including normative statements.
