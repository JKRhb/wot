# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
## Chairs' Decision Process and Quorum
- The following relates only to decisions that the WG agrees can be delegated to chairs, which includes the following:
    - TBD, ex. rejecting unsolicited IE applications
- Chairs' decisions will generally by consensus of all three chairs
- Weekly meetings will be held just prior to main WoT working group call
- If the chairs cannot meet consensus on a decision, and a decision needs to be made immediately, a majority vote (2/3) process will be used.
- Consistent with the above, quorum is 2 out of 3 chairs.  If only one chair can make the chairs' meeting no decisions can be made, although some administrative work may take place (preparing agendas for the main call, etc).
- A chair not attending a meeting will be considered to be abstaining from voting.  Consistent with the above, if only two chairs are present in a meeting and cannot agree on a decision, it will have to be deferred until the third chair can join.
