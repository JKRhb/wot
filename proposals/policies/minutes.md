# Web of Things (WoT) Policy (Draft)
## Minutes
- During each WoT main call or WoT TF call,
  there will be an opportunity for corrections to be made to the draft minutes of previous calls.
- Draft minutes will be made available at a URL of the form <code>https://www.w3.org/yyyy/mm/dd-wot-minutes.html</code>
  not less than 48 hours before each call (for the main call) and similar forms for TF calls.
- We will generally NOT review minutes in calls unless a group member mentions a need for a correction.
- It is the responsibility of group members to review minutes prior to each call.
    - The chairs in particular must review the minutes of the main call, and task force leads are responsible for reviewing the minutes of task forces.
- For exceptional (non-repeating) meetings, such as testfests, plugfests, and planning meetings, minutes will be confirmed in the main call.
    - Generally, unless a need for correction is raised, time will not be spend in the main call reviewing such minutes.
    - In these cases an email should be sent out prior to the main call with links to the minutes at least 48 hours in advance.
