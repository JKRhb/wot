# Web of Things (WoT) Policy
## Policy Adoption
- To propose a new policy, first create a PR against [wot/proposals/policies](https://github.com/w3c/wot/main/proposals/policies).
    - Comments taken on the PR can be used for gathering feedback during "development"
- When the PR for the proposed policy is deemed ready to be discussed by the entire group, it can be merged and a call-for-resolution to adopt it should be sent by email to the entire group, with a link to the proposed policy.
- At least two weeks should be given between the call for resolution and the actual resolution, which should be tabled in the WoT main call.
- Once a resolution has passed for a proposed policy, it should be moved to [wot/policies](https://github.com/w3c/wot/main/policies) and will be considered immediately active.
