# Web of Things Thing Description Work Items

The work items are split into two categories. The first category focuses on work items that are more about restructuring, redesigning and improving the usability of the specification. These could pave the way to new features.
The second category is about work items that are directly linked to new features.

Also, see https://w3c.github.io/wot-charter-drafts/wot-wg-2023-details and https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/WG_WoT_Thing_Description_WebConf (July 5 Agenda)
