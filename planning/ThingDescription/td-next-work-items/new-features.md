# Feature Aiming Work Items

For new features (keywords or behavior), a use case (or user story) should exist in the first place.
While the refactoring topics are being worked on, new features should not be incorporated into the specification.
Instead, the TF will analyze current solutions, gather existing use cases and discussions, and write the requirements to shape the feature.
These are contained in this folder with the `analysis-` prefix.

- Timeseries / Historical Data
- Manageable Actions
- Streaming
- Signing and Canonicalization (there is discussion on where this should belong)
  - TD Versioning
