# Testing and Tooling

- Linting
- TD Testing for plugfest and testfests: Currently it is at Eclipse Thingweb Playground at <https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/playground/tree/master/packages/assertions> but we should move it here.
- Bugfixes (updates for the TD next. Actual bugs for 1.1 should be handled as errata)
- Examples reorganization: It would be better to have complete TD examples that can be validated but at the same time we can show a part of it for specific features. Also, see <https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/1851>.
