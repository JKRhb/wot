# Testing and Tooling

## Linting

Linting rules exist for programming languages or for API specifications in order to establish custom rules within projects. 
How these rules can be defined for TDs is not specified in any way, making it difficult to constrain flexibility of TDs in a standardized manner. 
The WG will define the mechanism for linting TDs together with optional rules that can be used by different projects.

## Testing Procedure

Currently it is at Eclipse Thingweb Playground at <https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/playground/tree/master/packages/assertions> but we should move it here.

## Bugfixes

Small updates for the TD next. Actual bugs for 1.1 should be handled as errata

## Examples reorganization

It would be better to have complete TD examples that can be validated but at the same time we can show a part of it for specific features.
Also, see <https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/1851>.
