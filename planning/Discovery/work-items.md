# Web of Things (WoT) Discovery
## Work Items
Prioritized list of work items related to Discovery.
- Detailed descriptions of work items will be in a single list (in a separate document) to accomodate
  work items that impact more than one deliverable.
- Each work item has a link to its detailed description (Note: will need to be updated when this file moves), and a link to the requirement(s) it satisfies or helps satisfy.
- Note that requirements will also link in turn to the use cases that motivate it.
- Priority is given by the ordering in the list, from most to least important.
     - No ties allowed; this is called force-ranking and is intentional.
 
To do:
- Assign "categories" to work items to cluster them into a smaller number of "feature sets"
