# Web of Things (WoT) Architecture

## Decisions
To be discussed during planning.

### Informative vs. Normative
Should we make Architecture informative?

### Restructuring
What purposes does the Architecture document serve, and how can it be restructured to serve these purposes better?
1. First introduction/explainer.
2. Overview and guide to other deliverables and building blocks.  Note: not all building blocks are normative, e.g. Scripting API.
3. Defines overall abstract architecture.
4. Defines some (normative) requirements for other documents, e.g. use of URLs, IRIs, constraints on relational types, media types, etc. 
5. Describes applications domains (overlaps with Use Cases deliverable).
6. Describes usage patterns (overlaps with Use Cases deliverable).
7. Describes example deployments.
8. Defines terminology.
9. Security and privacy (normative) assertions.
10. General accessibility considerations (new, non-normative).

### Security Assertions
If Architecture is made informative, what should we do with existing normative security content?
Options include:
1. Make all security content informative.
2. Move normative security content to a Profile - they apply primarily to greenfield systems.
3. Move normative security content to a new normative Security deliverable - would require modifying the charter.
4. Move normative security content to other deliverables, e.g. to TD or Discovery.

### Privacy Assertions
Same options as with security, although privacy assertions tend to be more "policy-like".
