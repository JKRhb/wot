# Improved Web of Things Unifies Diverse IoT Systems [DRAFT]
** THIS IS A DRAFT.  The WoT deliverables cited below are still in Proposed Recommendation status.**

https://www.w3.org/ — DD MM 2023 — The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced today that 
[Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/),
[Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/), 
and 
[WoT Discovery](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/)
are now official W3C Recommendations.
Without breaking compatibility with the [first release in 2020](https://www.w3.org/2020/04/pressrelease-wot-rec.html),
these new W3C Recommendations improve and expand the scope of the Web of Things,
and add significant new functionality.

<!-- Why is it important? -->
## WoT Addresses the IoT Fragmentation Problem
Currently, IoT systems suffer from lack of interoperability and fragmentation.
Customers want to be able to choose devices from multiple vendors without redesign.
The WoT recommendations provide a format for standardized descriptive information, 
the WoT Thing Description, to allow easy integration of IoT devices and services.
This includes IoT systems that have already been released and use different IoT 
communication protocols and data standards.
In short, the WoT uses web technology to harmonize access to diverse
IoT devices an breaks silo walls.

<!-- What is new? -->
## Significant Improvements and Functionality
Thing Models provide a way to describe classes of things, such as product lines from particular vendors.
Discovery provides easy access to Thing Descriptions, while controlling access appropriately to preserve privacy.

<!-- What is the impact? -->
## Widely Adopted and Supported
{Testimonials from WG members}

Many [software packages and open-source projects now support WoT](https://www.w3.org/WoT/developers/), including
tools for Thing Description validation and construction as well as support for Thing runtimes and 
Thing Description directories supporting discovery.

The Web of Things has been adopted or is under consideration for adoption by
several other standards organizations, including ECHONET, OPC UA, and IPA DADC.
