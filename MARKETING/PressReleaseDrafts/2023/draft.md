# Improved Web of Things Unifies Diverse IoT Systems

The W3C Web of Things Working Group has recently published three new W3C Recommendations: 
[WoT Thing Description 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/), 
[WoT Discovery](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/), 
and 
[WoT Architecture 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/).
Without breaking compatibility with the [first release in 2020](https://www.w3.org/2020/04/pressrelease-wot-rec.html),
these new recommendations improve and expand the scope of the Web of Things,
and add significant new functionality.

## Why is it important?
Currently, IoT systems suffer from lack of interoperability and fragmentation.
Customers want to be able to choose devices from multiple vendors without redesign.
The WoT recommendations provide a format for standardized descriptive information to allow easy integration of IoT devices and services.
This includes IoT systems that have already been released and use different IoT communication protocols and data standards.

## What is new?
Thing Models provide a way to describe classes of things, such as product lines from particular vendors.
Discovery provides easy access to Thing Descriptions, while controlling access appropriately to preserve privacy.

## What is the impact?
{Testimonials from WG members}
Software packages and projects (OSS)
Adoption by adjacent SDOs (ECHONET and OPC UA and IPA DADC)
User community (users that are not WG members, WoT CG)
