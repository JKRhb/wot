There are several options how the development of the OPC UA Binding for the Web of Things can be managed:

# As W3C Note
W3C members setup an OPC UA Binding document as W3C Note. OPC UA experts can be involved for getting feedback.
OPC UA *may* later adopt it or modify it as a companion specification.

Pro
* aligned with existing approaches such as Modbus Binding

Cons
* no testing / conformance testing provided

# Develop W3C Note, transform it later into a W3C REC
A previously developed W3C Note about OPC UA Binding can be used or transformed to a REC. OPC UA experts can be involved for getting feedback. 
OPC UA *may* later adopt it or modify it as a companion specification.

Pro
* includes testing
* the decision to convert from a Note to a Rec will require AC review, which (if successful) will give the document more of a mandate from W3C as a whole
* assertions and RFC2119 keywords will be more appropriate

Cons
* still no conformance testing provided
* requires more time 


# As W3C REC only
W3C members setup an OPC UA Binding document as W3C Recommendation. OPC UA experts can be involved for getting feedback in that work. 

Pro
* includes testing
* as above, "mandate" and "assertive language" benefits

Cons
* still no conformance testing provided

# As OPC UA Companion Standard only
OPCF Members setup an OPC UA Binding document as OPC UA Companion. W3C WoT experts can be involved for getting feedback.

Pro
*  conformance testing organized by OPC UA according to their needs.
*  follows the new de-coupling binding approache of the new WoT charter
