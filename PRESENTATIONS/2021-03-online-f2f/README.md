# Presentation Material from March 2021 Online WoT F2F

[various dates from 15 March 2021 to 25 March 2021](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting,_March_2021#Agenda).
This directory will be used to archive presentations and make them available to people
who may not have access to screen sharing during the F2F.
All presenters should upload their presentations, ideally in advance of their session.
Please use a name in the format `2021-03-DD-WoT-Session-Presenter.{pptx,pdf}`,
for example `2021-03-15-WoT-Opening-McCool.{pptx,pdf}`.
Whatever main format you use, please export and check in a PDF as well.
This makes it easier to browse presentations in github.

If you use Powerpoint, see 
[the PPTX template](Template-2021-03-DD-WoT-Session-Presenter.potx).
