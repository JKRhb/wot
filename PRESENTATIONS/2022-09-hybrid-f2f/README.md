# Presentation Material from September 2022 hybrid WoT F2F
This hybrid F2F will be held on
[various dates from 6 September 2022 to 22 September 2022](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting,_September_2022).
This directory will be used to archive presentations and make them available to people
who may not have access to screen sharing during the F2F.
All presenters should upload their presentations, ideally in advance of their session.
Please use a name in the format `2022-09-DD-WoT-F2F-Session-Presenter.{pptx,pdf}`,
for example `2022-09-15-WoT-F2F-Opening-McCool.{pptx,pdf}`.
Whatever main format you use, please export and check in a PDF as well.
This makes it easier to browse presentations in github.

If you use Powerpoint, see 
[the PPTX template](Template-2022-09-DD-WoT-F2F-Session-Presenter.potx).
Use of this template is optional if you already have material you are reusing,
but is preferred for new material.

Here are links to the presentations, in order by agenda.
