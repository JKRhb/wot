# Security and Privacy
Summary of main points from discussion.

- Security is multifaceted
    - multiple sources of concerns: software stack or hardware, user error, inappropriate use, configuration errors, etc.
    - process: "vulnerability" that is then "exploited" by an attacker.
    - this is what the "Threat Model" addresses
    - However, considerations don't necessarily reflect, e.g. vulnerabilities -> exploits -> risks, etc.
    - Policy vs. feature: where are assertions appropriate?  Need testability.
    - Want actionable information
- Safety vs. Security
    - Knowing when an exploit be harmful
    - Define of safety-critical features/devices/affordances?
    - New type of document for safety guidelines?
- Governance on user data
    - Important for smart city also
    - should survey existing guidelines (e.g. from governments) on user data governance
    - done collaboratively with the newly proposed Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities IG
- Developer awareness
    - Maybe we should extend the specification with more hints
    - Explicit links to the S&P guidelines document for relevant topics
- Existing standards
    - why don't we use the existing standards which deal with security in automation
    - we need to re-open that analysis, do new survey: IoT Alliance, IoT SF, etc.
    - Need to consider domain, e.g. Smart Home vs. Factory Automation
    - Security is what certification lab says it is...
    - Different domains will be sensitive to different risks
         - e.g. Health will have PII concerns, Factory Automation not so much
