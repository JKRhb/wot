# WoT Presentation Material for September 2023 TPAC
TPAC 2023 will be held during the week of 
[11 September 2022 to 15 September 2022]([https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting,_September_2022](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/)).
This directory will be used to archive presentations for the WoT sessions
and make them available to people
who may not have access to screen sharing during TPAC.
All presenters should upload their presentations, ideally in advance of their session.
Please use a name in the format `2023-09-DD-WoT-F2F-Session-Presenter.{pptx,pdf}`,
for example `2023-09-15-WoT-F2F-Security-McCool.{pptx,pdf}`.  The "Session" value should be one
or two words summarizing the topic, and will also be used in the table of contents.
Whatever main format you use, please export and check in a PDF as well.
This makes it easier to browse presentations in github.

If you use Powerpoint, see 
[the PPTX template](Template-2023-09-DD-WoT-TPAC-Session-Presenter.potx).
Use of this template is optional if you already have material you are reusing,
but is preferred for new material.

Here are links to the presentations, in order by the
[agenda](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Main_WoT_WebConf/2023_WoT_TPAC_Agenda#TPAC_Agenda).
